# Zillowette

#### By Kai Turanski

[WIP - Planned release in July 2025]

Chrome extension that allows you to comment on zillow posts. Inspired by Hank Green's [tweet](https://x.com/hankgreen/status/147950988737364378) suggesting that zillow should have comments.

Name inspired by [Peter Corless](https://x.com/PeterCorless/status/1479513004580360196) on twitter.
