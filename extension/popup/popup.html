        <h1>Zillow Commenter</h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Zillow Commenter</strong> is a Chrome extension that lets you add and view comments on Zillow listings, making house hunting more interactive and fun!
        </p>
        <p>
            This idea was inspired by a <a href="https://x.com/hankgreen/status/1479509887373643780" target="_blank">Hank Green</a> post on Twitter, where he imagined what it would be like if people could leave comments on Zillow homesâ€”just like on social media.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use this extension to share your thoughts, jokes, or insights on any Zillow property you find!
